                    This is where really great stuff about me goes. There's alot of really great stuff about  
                    me. It's not like I'm struggling to find anything: there's tons of stuff. There's so much 
                    stuff I have trouble keeping it all in my mind at one time. That's the problem really. It for 
                    sure isn't that I don't know what to write here, that’s ridiculous. I don’t know why you’d even 
                    consider that. For example, did you know that I can spit a watermelon seed no less than 4-5 
                    feet with the wind at my back? I bet you didn’t. And I bet you feel pretty silly for doubting 
                    me right about now.

                    Anywhoo, I manage investments and such during the day, but by night … I also manage investments. 
                    Or, like, sleep or maybe watch some Netflix. I’m pretty gud at math; I know all of my PEMDAS and 
                    can pretty much count to infinity. It’d be swell if you hired me to do the thing you need done. 
                    You know the one; I’m good at it I promise. I’ve published papers in science journals and stuff, 
                    and I’m good at businessing, and I barely even need external validation. But if you’d like to give 
                    me some I won’t say no. I’ll just wait here. For the validation I don’t crave. Patiently ... Oh so 
                    patiently.
